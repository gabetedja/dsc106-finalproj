        <h2>Final Project Write-Up</h2>
        <p>Our intention is to use the climate change data from the CMIP6 dataset to present this slice of data from 2010, using the metrics
            temperature, ozone, and pressure and connect it
            to how we can explain climate trends today. While a single year may seem like not enough data to work with, the trends
            are quite coherent across the data.
            <p>Looking at the data, indexing all these metrics by latitude allows audiences
            to more easily understand the profound effects it has on the climate on a seasonal basis.
            The temperature metric is easy to understand, as by latitude the Northern Hemisphere
            will get warmer as the South gets cooler, and vice versa. Ozone shows higher variability
            at higher latitudes, and pressure has highly variable behavior at higher latitudes with more consistently
            high pressures at subtropics. </p>

            <p>If a single year provides data with this much consistency and explainability, then these structures seem rather fundamental
            in understanding our climate.</p>
